Upon this hill
I plundered from the pool
I look around
I search the skies
I shade my eyes
So nearly blind
And I see signs of half remembered days
I hear bells that chime in strange familiar ways
I recognise...
The hope you kindle in your eyesIt's oh so easy now
As we lie here in the dark
Nothing interferes, it's obvious
How to beat the tears
That threaten to snuff out
The spark of our love

Doctor Doctor what is wrong with me
This supermarket life is getting long
What is the heart life of a colour TV
What is the shelf life of a teenage queenOoh western woman
Ooh western girl
News hound sniffs the air
When Jessica Hahn goes downHe latches on to that symbol
Of detachment
Attracted by the peeling away of feeling
The celebrity of the abused shell the belleOoh western woman
Ooh western girl
And the children of Melrose
Strut their stuffIs absolute zero cold enough
And out in the valley warm and clean
The little ones sit by their TV screens
No thoughts to thinkNo tears to cry
All sucked dry
Down to the very last breath
Bartender what is wrong with meWhy am I so out of breath
The captain said excuse me ma'am
This species has amused itself to death
Amused itself to deathAmused itself to death
We watched the tragedy unfold
We did as we were told
We bought and soldIt was the greatest show on earth
But then it was over
We ohhed and aahed
We drove our racing carsWe ate our last few jars of caviar
And somewhere out there in the stars
A keen-eyed look-out
Spied a flickering lightOur last hurrah
And when they found our shadows
Grouped around the TV sets
They ran down every leadThey repeated every test
They checked out all the data on their lists
And then the alien anthropologists
Admitted they were still perplexedBut on eliminating every other reason
For our sad demise
They logged the only explanation left
This species has amused itself to deathNo tears to cry no feelings left
This species has amused itself to death"Years later, I saw Bill Hubbard's name on the memorial to the missing
at Aras. And I...when I saw his name I was absolutely transfixed; it
was as though he was now a human being instead of some sort of
nightmarish memory of how I had to leave him, all those years ago.
And I felt relieved, and ever since then I've felt happier about it,
because always before, whenever I thought of him, I said to myself,
'Was there something else that I could have done?'"I'd rather die, I'd rather die..."And that always sort of worried me. And having seen him, and his
name in the register - as you know in the memorials there's a little safe,
there's a register in there with every name - and seeing his name and
his name on the memorial; it sort of lightened my...heart, if you like.""When was it that you saw his name on the memorial?""Ah, when I was eighty-seven, that would be a year, ninete...eighty-
four, nineteen eighty-four."

Standing at the window
A farmer's wife in Oxford shire
Glances at the clock; it's nearly time for tea
She doesn't see
The phantom in the hedgerow dip its wings
Doesn't hear the engine sing
But in the cockpit's techno glow
Behind the Ray Ban shine
The kid from Cleveland
In the comfort of routine
Scans his dials and smiles
Secure in the beauty of military life
There is no right or wrong
Only tin cans and cordite and white cliffs
And blue skies and flight flight flight
The beauty of military life
No questions only orders and flight, only flight
What a beautiful sight in his wild blue dream
The eternal child leafs through his war magazine
And his kind Uncle Sam feeds ten trillion in change
Into the total entertainment combat video game
And up here in the stands
The fans are going wild
The cheerleaders flip
When you wiggle your hip
And we all like the bit when you take
The jeans from the refrigerator and
Then the bad guy gets hit
And were you struck by the satisfying way
The swimsuit sticks to her skin
Like BB gun days
When knives pierce autumn leaves
But that's okay see the children bleed
It'll look great on the TV
And in Tripoli another ordinary wife
Stares at the dripping tap her old man hadn't
Time to fix
Too busy mixing politics and rhythm
In the street below

Einse, svei, drei, alle!
So ya thought ya
Might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow
I got some bad news for you, Sunshine
Pink isn't well
He stayed back at the hotel
And they've sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand
Are there any queers in the theatre tonight?
Get 'em up against the wall
There's one in the spotlight
Now he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall
And that one looks Jewish
And that one's a coon

There's one smoking a joint
And that one's got spots

Hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?Come on, now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease the pain
And get you on your feet againRelax
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understandThis is not how I am
I have become comfortably numbI have become comfortably numbOkay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ahh
But you may feel a little sickCan you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to goThere is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it nowThe child is grown, the dream is gone

Come, hold me now, I am not gone
I would not leave you here alone
In this dead calm beneath the waves
I can still hear those lost boys callingYou could not speak, you were afraid
To take the risk of being left again
And so you tipped your hat and waved and then
You turned back up the gangway of that steel tomb againAnd in Mott street in July
When I hear those seabirds cry
I hold the child, the child in the man
The child that we leave behindAnd in Mott street in July
When I hear those seabirds cry
I hold the child, the child in the man
The child that we leave behindThe spotlight fades, the boys disband
The final notes lie mute upon the sand
And in the silence of the grave
I can still hear those lost boys callingWe left them there when they were young
The men were gone until the west was won
And now there's nothing left but time to kill
You never took us fishin' dad and now you never willAnd in Mott street in July

I hold the child, the child in the man

Could be Llanelli, and it could be Warrington
Could be Warsaw, and it could be Moose Jaw
Could be Rome
Everybody got somewhere they call home
When they overrun the defences
A minor invasion put down to expenses
Will you go down to the airport lounge
Will you accept your second class status
A nation of waitresses and waiters
Will you mix their martinis
Will you stand still for it
Or will you take to the hillsIt could be clay and it could be sand
Could be desert
Could be a tract of arable land
Could be a house, could be a corner shop
Could be a cabin by a bend in the river
Could be something your old man handed down
Could be something you built on your own
Everybody got something he calls homeWhen the cowboys and Arabs draw down
On each other at noon
In the cool dusty air of the city boardroom
Will you stand by a passive spectator
Of the market dictators
Will you discreetly withdraw
With your ear pressed to the boardroom door
Will you hear when the lion within you roars
Will you take to the hillsWill you stand, will you stand for it
Will you hear, ohhhh! ohhh! when the lion within you roarsCould be your father and it could be your mother
Could be your sister, could be your brother
Could be a foreigner, could be a Turk
Could be a cyclist out looking for work. Norman

Could be a loser or it could be a winner
Could be a banker, could be a baker
Could be a Laker, could be Kareem Abdul Jabar
Could be a male voice choir
Could be a lover, could be a fighter
Could be a super heavyweight, or it could be
something lighter
Could be a cripple, could be a freak
Could be a wop, gook, geek
Could be a cop, could be a thief
Could be a family of ten living in one room on relief
Could be our leaders in their concrete tombs
With their tinned food and their silver spoons
Could be the pilot with God on his side
Could be the kid in the middle of the bomb sight
Could be a fanatic, could be a terrorist
Could be a dentist, could be a psychiatrist
Could be humble, could be proud
Could be a face in the crowd
Could be the soldier in the white cravat
Who turns the key in spite of the fact
That this is the end of the cat and mouse
Who dwelt in the house
Where the laughter rang and the tears were spilt
The house that Jack built
Where the laughter rang and the tears were spilt
The house that Jack built

Not the torturer will scare me
Nor the body's final fall
Nor the barrels of death's rifles
Nor the shadows on the wall
Nor the night when to the ground
The last dim star of pain, is hurled
But the blind indifference
Of a merciless, unfeeling worldLying in the burnt out shell
Of some Albanian farm
An old Babushka
Holds a crying baby in her arms
A soldier from the other side
A man of heart and pride
Breaks ranks, lays down his rifle
To kneel by her sideHe gives her water
Binds her wounds
And calms the crying child
A touch gives absolution then
Across the great divide
He picks his way back through the broken
China of her life
And there at the curb
The samaritan Serb turns and waves ... goodbyeAnd each small candle
Lights a corner of the dark
Each small candle
Lights a corner of the dark
Each small candle lights a corner of the dark
When the wheel of pain stops turning
And the branding iron stops burning
When the children can be children
When the desperados weaken
When the tide rolls into greet them
And the natural law of science
Greets the humble and the mighty
And the billion candles burning
Lights the dark side of every human mindEach small candle
Each small candle (repeated)
Each small candles lights the dark side of every human mindAnd each small candle
Lights a corner of the dark

So I stood by the roadside
The soles of my running shoes gripping
The tarmac like gunmetal magnets
Fixed on the front of her Fassbinder face
Was the kind of a smile
That only a rather dull child could have drawn
While attempting a graveyard in the moonlight
But she was impressed
You could see that she thought I looked fine
And when she turned sweeter
The reason, between you and me, was
She'd just seen my green Lamborghini
[RW:] "I think it was the Lamborghini."
So we went for a spin in the country
To feel the wind in our hair
To feel the power of my engine
To feel the thrill of desireAnd then in the trees I heard a twig snap
Warning lights flashed on my map
I opened my eyes and to my surprise
There were Arabs with knives at the front of the bed
Right at the front of the bed
Oh my God, how did they get in here
I thought we were safe home in England
She said, come on now kid, it was wrong what you did
You've got to admit it was wrong what you did
You've got to admit it was wrong

There's a full time reservation
Made in a bar at the railway station,
And there's a story, a kind of fable,
On a card at the corner table.
On it is a message; been there some time.
It starts of, "The coffee tasted so fine"It says, "One day, this may find you,
These few words may remind you.
We sat here together just to pass time;
You said how the coffee tasted so fine."It goes on to say, "I love you
If you should find this I must hear from you."
It gives a number but the name has faded away.
All that is left are just the words, "Maybe someday"That's the story and the fable;
Never leave alone from a corner table.
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo.
Doo doo-doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo.

When the sleigh is heavy
And the timber wolves are getting bold
You look at you companions
And test the water of their friendshipWith your toe
They significantly edge
Closer to the gold
Each man has his price BobAnd yours was pretty low
History is short the sun is just a minor star
The poor man sells his kidneys
In some colonial bazaarQue sera sera
Is that your new Ferrari car
Nice but I think I'll wait for the F50
You don't have to be a JewTo disapprove of murder
Tears burn our eyes
Moslem or Christian Mullah or Pope
Preacher or poet who was it wroteGive any one species too much rope
And they'll fuck it up
And last night on TV
A Vietnam vetTakes his beard and his pain
And his alienation twenty years
Back to Asia again
Sees the monsters they madeIn formaldehyde floating 'round
Meets a gook on a bike
A good little tyke
A nice enough guy
With the same soldier's eyesTears burn my eyes
What does it mean
This tear jerking scene
Beamed into my homeThat it moves me so much
Why all the fuss
It's only two humans being
It's only two humans beingTears burn my eyes
What does it mean
This tender TV
This tear jerking sceneBeamed into my home
You don't have to be a Jew
To disapprove of murder
Tears burn in our eyesMuslim or Christian Mullah or Pope
Preacher or poet who was it wrote
Give any one species too much rope
And they'll fuck it up

The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games
And daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the pathThe lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paper boy brings moreAnd if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moonThe lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade
You make the change
And you rearrange me 'till I'm sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
And there's someone in my head, but it's not me

And the moment of clarity
Faded like charity does
Sometimes
I open one eye
And I put out my hand just to touch your soft hair
To make sure in the darkness that you were still there
And I have to admit
I was just a little afraid
Yeah
But then...
I had a little bit of luck
You were awake
I couldn't take another moment alone

(Apparently they were travelling abroad)
(And they picked up some hitchhikers)
[Jade:] "Oh God...."
[Wife:] "Wake up you're dreaming."
[Jade:] "What?"
[Wife:] "You're dreaming."
[Jade:] "We were moving away from the border."
[Wife:] "Huh, what border?"
[Jade:] "Have a nice day."
[Wife:] "Huh?"
[Jade:] "Have a nice day."We were moving away from the border
Looking for somewhere to sleep
The two of us sharing the driving
Two hitchhikers slumped in the back seat
[Woman:] "Hello"
I sneaked a quick look in the mirror
She gave me a smile
I said, is anyone hungry?
Should we stop for a while?
So we pulled off into a layby
Her dress blew up over her head
I said, would you like to come with me?
She said something foreign under her breath
[Woman:] "(foreign words)"
And the sun shone down on her lovely young limbs
I thought to myself she's much too good for you
I lay down beside her with tears in my eyes
She said

Rock a bye baby
On the tree top
When the wind blows
The cradle will rock
Oooh babe, hate to see you fall that way
Better speak to the powers that be today
Hey Joe, where you goin'
With that gun in your hand?
You can take your revenge
But you'll still feel bad
There must be more to life than lucky strikes
And some unlucky ones
And folded flags and pipes
And drumsI stood in the wings with you
Our lives in the hands of a second-rate actor
Holding the high ground
Of center stage
Oooh babe, how do these jaded stars get so far away
Will they catch what the other actors sayHey Joe, where you goin'
With that dogma in your head?
You can prove your point
But your kids will still be dead
Bring down the curtain
This soap opera must surely close
Before the cold wind blowsHey Joe, where you going
With that gun in your hand
You can take your revenge
But you'll still feel bad

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skys from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
And hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?How I wish
How I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimmin' in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
And I wish that you were hereOh, how I wish you were here
How I wish
How I wish you were here
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
And I wish that you were here

Reached back for the bottle
And rubbed against the lamp
Genie came out smiling
Like some Eastern trampHe said hey boy what's happening
What is going on
You can have three wishes
If you don't take too longI said well
I wish they were all happy in the Lebanon
Wish somebody'd help me write this song
I wish when I was youngMy old man had not been gone
Genie said consider it done
There's something in the air
And you don't know what it isYou see someone through the window
Who you've just learned to miss
And the road leads on to glory but
You've used up your last wishYour last wish
And you want her to come home
Genie said I'm sorry
But that's the way it goesWhere the hell's the lamp sucker
It's time for me to go

Hey...girl
Take out the dagger
And let's have a stab at the sexual revolution
Hey girl
Let freedom for all be our rallying call
Tomorrow lets make our new resolution
Yeah, but tonight lie still
While I plunder your sweet grave
And remember
Only the poor can be saved
Hey girl
As I've always said I prefer your lips red
Not what the good Lord made
But what he intended
Hey girl
Don't point the finger at me
I am only a rat in a maze like you
Only the dead go free
So...please, hold my hand
As we blunder through the maze
And remember
Nothing can grow without rain
(Thunder)
Don't...
Don't point your finger at me
I awoke in a fever
The bedclothes were all soaked in sweat
She said, you've been having a nightmare
And it's not over yet
Then she picked up the doggy in the window
(The one with the waggly tail)
And she put him to bed between two bits of bread

Hey you, out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you, standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you, don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight.Hey you, out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you, with you ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home.But it was only fantasy.
The wall was too high,
As you can see.
No matter how he tried,
He could not break free.
And the worms ate into his brain.Hey you, out there on the road
always doing what you're told,
Can you help me?
Hey you, out there beyond the wall,
Breaking bottles in the hall,
Can you help me?
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall.

Pass by the magic eye

Ooooh, the lonely boys
In their towers of faith
Ooooh, the lonely boys
Locked in their towers of faithThe prophet reclined
On the Golan HeightsOhhh, the lonely boysHe said, this land is my land
To the ShiitesOoooh, the lonely boysAnd Jehova looked up from the sea of Galilee beneath
He said, I see you, you thief
This land is my land
And this sand is my sand
And this band is my band
Oh the lonely boys
Lookin' over their shoulder
Checkin out every boulder in the park
Where the gates are closed from hate
After darkAnd the Pope rolled up in his armored van
He fell on his knees and kissed the land
He said something that I did not understand
It was in polish
Then up stepped an aide
He said, I will translate
Here is what His Holiness said:
'I am the Chief Jesuit.'
'This land is Jesus' land.'
'And that is all'
'All that there is to it.'
Hail Mary
Mother of GodAnd in New York City
The business man in his mohair suit
In the world trade center
Puffs on his cheroot
And he said,
Well I don't care who owns the desert sands
My brief
Is with the hydrocarbons underneath
And the sea of battle rages
Around the ancient tombs
And mother nature licks her wounds
And the lonely boys locked in their towers of faith
Who are nervous in the park
When the gates are closed after dark
Ooooh, the lonely boys
In their towers of faith
Ooooh, the lonely boys

Get away
Get a good job with good pay and you're okay

Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash

Get back
But I'm all right Jack
Keep your hands off of my stack
Money
It's a hit
But don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity, first class, travelling set

I used to think the world was flat
Rarely threw my hat into the crowd
I felt I had used up my quota of yearning
Used to look in on the children at nightIn the glow of their Donald Duck light
And frighten myself with the thought of my little ones burning
But, oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning
The tide is turningSatellite buzzing through the endless night
Exclusive to moonshots and world title fights
Jesus Christ imagine what it must be earning
Who is the strongestWho is the best
Who holds the aces
The East
Or the WestThis is the crap our children are learning
But oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning
The tide is turning
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turningNow the satellite's confused
'Cause on Saturday night
The airwaves were full of compassion and light
And his silicon heart warmedTo the sight of a billion candles burning
Oo, oo, oo, the tide is turning
Oo, oo, oo, the tide is turning
The tide is turning BillyI'm not saying that the battle is won
But on Saturday night all those kids in the sun
Wrested technology's sword from the hand of the war lords
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turningThe tide is turning Sylvester
The tide is turning
"That's it!
Now the past is over but you are not aloneTogether we'll fight Sylvester Stallone
We will not be dragged down in his South China Sea
Of macho bullshit and mediocrity"

Little by little the night turns around
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the eaves the swallow is resting
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
Over the mountain
Watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness
Waking the grapevine
Knowledge of love is knowledge of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun
The heart of the sun (repeating)
Witness the man who waves at the wall
Making the shape of his question to heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun
The heart of the sun (repeating)

So I stood by the roadside
The soles of my running shoes gripping
The tarmac like gunmetal magnets
Fixed on the front of her Fassbinder face
Was the kind of a smile
That only a rather dull child could have drawn
While attempting a graveyard in the moonlight
But she was impressed
You could see that she thought I looked fine
And when she turned sweeter
The reason, between you and me, was
She'd just seen my green Lamborghini
[RW:] "I think it was the Lamborghini."
So we went for a spin in the country
To feel the wind in our hair
To feel the power of my engine
To feel the thrill of desireAnd then in the trees I heard a twig snap
Warning lights flashed on my map
I opened my eyes and to my surprise
There were Arabs with knives at the front of the bed
Right at the front of the bed
Oh my God, how did they get in here
I thought we were safe home in England
She said, come on now kid, it was wrong what you did
You've got to admit it was wrong what you did
You've got to admit it was wrong

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the wayTired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
And you are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today
And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gunAnd you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again
And the sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to deathEvery year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to nought
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone
The song is over
Thought I'd something more to sayHome, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fireFar away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell

The ozone overflows with radio waves
AM, FM, weather, and news
Our leaders had a frank exchange of views
Are you confused?

An angel on a Harley
Pulls across to greet a fellow rolling stone
Puts his bike up on it's stand
Leans back and then extends
A scarred and greasy hand...he said
He said, how ya doin bro?
Where ya been?
Where ya goin'?
Then he takes your hand
In some strange Californian handshake
And breaks the bone
[Whiny person:] "Have a nice day, hehe"A housewife from Encino
Whose husband's on the golf course
With his book of rules
Breaks and makes a 'U' and idles back
To take a second look at you
You flex your rod
Fish takes the hook
Sweet vodka and tobacco in her breath
Another number in your little black bookThese are the pros and cons of hitchhiking
These are the pros and cons of hitchhiking
Oh babe, I must be dreamingI'm standing on the leading edge
The Eastern seaboard spread before my eyes
Jump, says Yoko Ono
I'm too scared and too good looking, I cried
Go on, she says
Why don't you give it a try?
Why prolong the agony all men must die
Do you remember Dick Tracy?
Do you remember Shane?

Could you see him selling tickets
Where the buzzard circles over

So we left Beirut Willa and I
He headed East to Baghdad and the rest of it
I set out North
I walked the five or six miles to the last of the street lamps
And hunkered in the curb side dusk
Holding out my thumb
In no great hope at the ramshackle procession of home bound traffic
Success!
An ancient Mercedes 'dolmus '
The ubiquitous, Arab, shared taxi drew up
I turned out my pockets and shrugged at the driver
" J'ai pas de l'argent "
" Venez! " A soft voice from the back seat
The driver lent wearily across and pushed open the back door
I stooped to look inside at the two men there
One besuited, bespectacled, moustached, irritated, distant, late
The other, the one who had spoken,
Frail, fifty five-ish, bald, sallow, in a short sleeved pale blue cotton shirt
With one biro in the breast pocket
A clerk maybe, slightly sunken in the seat
"Venez!" He said again, and smiled
"Mais j'ai pas de l'argent"
"Oui, Oui, d'accord, Venez!"Are these the people that we should bomb
Are we so sure they mean us harm
Is this our pleasure, punishment or crime
Is this a mountain that we really want to climb
The road is hard, hard and long
Put down that two by four
This man would never turn you from his door
Oh George! Oh George!
That Texas education must have fucked you up when you were very smallHe beckoned with a small arthritic motion of his hand
Fingers together like a child waving goodbye
The driver put my old Hofner guitar in the boot with my rucksack
And off we went
" Vous etes Francais, monsieur? "
" Non, Anglais "
" Ah! Anglais "
" Est-ce que vous parlais Anglais, Monsieur? "
"Non, je regrette"
And so on
In small talk between strangers, his French alien but correct
Mine halting but eager to please
A lift, after all, is a lift
Late moustache left us brusquely
And some miles later the dolmus slowed at a crossroads lit by a single lightbulb
Swung through a U-turn and stopped in a cloud of dust
I opened the door and got out
But my benefactor made no move to follow
The driver dumped my guitar and rucksack at my feet
And waving away my thanks returned to the boot
Only to reappear with a pair of alloy crutches
Which he leaned against the rear wing of the Mercedes.
He reached into the car and lifted my companion out
Only one leg, the second trouser leg neatly pinned beneath a vacant hip
" Monsieur, si vous voulez, ca sera un honneur pour nous
Si vous venez avec moi a la maison pour manger avec ma femme "When I was 17 my mother, bless her heart, fulfilled my summer dream
She handed me the keys to the car
We motored down to Paris, fuelled with Dexedrine and booze
Got bust in Antibes by the cops
And fleeced in Naples by the wops
But everyone was kind to us, we were the English dudes
Our dads had helped them win the war
When we all knew what we were fighting for
But now an Englishman abroad is just a US stooge
The bulldog is a poodle snapping round the scoundrel's last refuge"Ma femme", thank God! Monopod but not queer
The taxi drove off leaving us in the dim light of the swinging bulb
No building in sight
What the hell
"Merci monsieur"
"Bon, Venez!"
His faced creased in pleasure, he set off in front of me
Swinging his leg between the crutches with agonising care
Up the dusty side road into the darkness
After half an hour we'd gone maybe half a mile
When on the right I made out the low profile of a building
He called out in Arabic to announce our arrival
And after some scuffling inside a lamp was lit
And the changing angle of light in the wide crack under the door
Signalled the approach of someone within
The door creaked open and there, holding a biblical looking oil lamp
Stood a squat, moustached woman, stooped smiling up at us
She stood aside to let us in and as she turned
I saw the reason for her stoop
She carried on her back a shocking hump
I nodded and smiled back at her in greeting, fighting for control
The gentleness between the one-legged man and his monstrous wife
Almost too much for meIs gentleness too much for us
Should gentleness be filed along with empathy
We feel for someone else's child
Every time a smart bomb does its sums and gets it wrong
Someone else's child dies and equities in defence rise
America, America, please hear us when we call
You got hip-hop, be-bop, hustle and bustle
You got Atticus Finch
You got Jane Russell
You got freedom of speech
You got great beaches, wildernesses and malls
Don't let the might, the Christian right, fuck it all up
For you and the rest of the worldThey talked excitedly
She went to take his crutches in routine of care
He chiding, gestured
We have a guest
She embarrassed by her faux pas
Took my things and laid them gently in the corner
"Du the?"
We sat on meagre cushions in one corner of the single room
The floor was earth packed hard and by one wall a raised platform
Some six foot by four covered by a simple sheet, the bed
The hunchback busied herself with small copper pots over an open hearth
And brought us tea, hot and sweet
And so to dinner
Flat, unleavened bread, + thin
Cooked in an iron skillet over the open hearth
Then folded and dipped into the soft insides of female sea urchins
My hostess did not eat, I ate her dinner
She would hear of nothing else, I was their guest
And then she retired behind a curtain
And left the men to sit drinking thimbles full of Arak
Carefully poured from a small bottle with a faded label
Soon she reappeared, radiant
Carrying in her arms their pride and joy, their child.
I'd never seen a squint like that
So severe that as one eye looked out the other disappeared behind its noseNot in my name, Tony, you great war leader you
Terror is still terror, whosoever gets to frame the rules
History's not written by the vanquished or the damned
Now we are Genghis Khan, Lucretia Borghia, Son of Sam
In 1961 they took this child into their home
I wonder what became of them
In the cauldron that was Lebanon
If I could find them now, could I make amends?
How does the story end?And so to bed, me that is, not them
Of course they slept on the floor behind a curtain
Whilst I lay awake all night on their earthen bed
Then came the dawn and then their quiet stirrings
Careful not to wake the guest
I yawned in great pretence
And took the proffered bowl of water heated up and washed
And sipped my coffee in its tiny cup
And then with much "merci-ing" and bowing and shaking of hands
We left the woman to her chores
And we men made our way back to the crossroads
The painful slowness of our progress accentuated by the brilliant morning light
The dolmus duly reappeared
My host gave me one crutch and leaning on the other
Shook my hand and smiled
"Merci, monsieur," I said
" De rien "
" And merci a votre femme, elle est tres gentille "
Giving up his other crutch
He allowed himself to be folded into the back seat again
"Bon voyage, monsieur," he said
And half bowed as the taxi headed south towards the city
I turned North, my guitar over my shoulder
And the first hot gust of wind
Quickly dried the salt tears from my young cheeks.

Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
Snapshot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what'd'ja leave behind for me?!?
All in all it was just a brick in the wall.

Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
Walking down the street, blind to every eye she meets
Do you think you'll be the guy to make the queen of the angels sigh?Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
She holds her head so high, like a statue in the sky
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long,
when she moves my brain screams out this song
Sidewalk crouches at her feet, like a dog that begs for something sweet
Do you hope to make her see you fool?
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game

An angel on a Harley
Pulls across to greet a fellow rolling stone
Puts his bike up on it's stand
Leans back and then extends
A scarred and greasy hand...he said
He said, how ya doin bro?
Where ya been?
Where ya goin'?
Then he takes your hand
In some strange Californian handshake
And breaks the bone
[Whiny person:] "Have a nice day, hehe"A housewife from Encino
Whose husband's on the golf course
With his book of rules
Breaks and makes a 'U' and idles back
To take a second look at you
You flex your rod
Fish takes the hook
Sweet vodka and tobacco in her breath
Another number in your little black bookThese are the pros and cons of hitchhiking
These are the pros and cons of hitchhiking
Oh babe, I must be dreamingI'm standing on the leading edge
The Eastern seaboard spread before my eyes
Jump, says Yoko Ono
I'm too scared and too good looking, I cried
Go on, she says
Why don't you give it a try?
Why prolong the agony all men must die
Do you remember Dick Tracy?
Do you remember Shane?
[Child:] "And mother wants you."
Could you see him selling tickets
Where the buzzard circles over
[Child:] "Shane."
The body on the plain
Did you understand the music Yoko
Or was it all in vain?

Momma loves her baby
And Daddy loves her, too
And the sea may look warm to ya, Baby
And the sky may look blue
BabyBaby Blue
Baby
If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern lifeDragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear-stained eyes
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feetYou slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out from behind you
As you claw the ice

(Apparently they were travelling abroad)
(And they picked up some hitchhikers)
[Jade:] "Oh God...."
[Wife:] "Wake up you're dreaming."
[Jade:] "What?"
[Wife:] "You're dreaming."
[Jade:] "We were moving away from the border."
[Wife:] "Huh, what border?"
[Jade:] "Have a nice day."
[Wife:] "Huh?"
[Jade:] "Have a nice day."We were moving away from the border
Looking for somewhere to sleep
The two of us sharing the driving
Two hitchhikers slumped in the back seat
[Woman:] "Hello"
I sneaked a quick look in the mirror
She gave me a smile
I said, is anyone hungry?
Should we stop for a while?
So we pulled off into a layby
Her dress blew up over her head
I said, would you like to come with me?
She said something foreign under her breath
[Woman:] "(foreign words)"
And the sun shone down on her lovely young limbs
I thought to myself she's much too good for you
I lay down beside her with tears in my eyes
She said

You shone like the sun
Shine on you crazy diamond
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky

Blown on the steel breeze
Come on you target for faraway laughter
Come on you stranger

You cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light

Rode on the steel breeze
Come on you raver
You seer of visions
Come on you painter
You piper

How near or how far
Shine on you crazy diamond
Pile on many more years

They disembarked in '45
And no one spoke
And no one smiled
There were too many spaces in the line
And gathered at the cenotaph
They all agreed with hand on heart
To sheath the sacrificial knives
But now
She stands upon Southampton dock
With her handkerchief
And her summer frock
Clings to her wet body in the rain
In quiet desperation
Knuckles white upon the slippery reins
She bravely waves the boys goodbye again
Ooo, Maggie what have you done?
And still the dark stain spreads between
Their shoulder blades
A mute reminder
Of the poppy fields and graves
When the fight was over
We spent what they had made
But
In the bottom of our hearts
We felt the final cut

We were watching T.V.
Watching T.V.
We were Watching T.V.
Watching T.V.In Tiananmen Square
Lost my baby there
My yellow rose
In her bloodstained clothesShe was a short order pastry chef
In a Dim Sum dive on the Yangtze tideway
She had shiny hair
She was the daughter of an engineerWon't you shed a tear
For my yellow rose
My yellow rose
In her bloodstained clothesShe had perfect breasts
She had high hopes
She had almond eyes
She had yellow thighsShe was a student of philosophy
Won't you grieve with me
For my yellow rose
Shed a tearFor her bloodstained clothes
She had shiny hair
She had perfect breasts
She had high hopesShe had almond eyes
She had yellow thighs
She was the daughter of an engineer
So get out your pistolsGet out your stones
Get out your knives
Cut them to the bone
They are the lackeys of the grocer's machineThey built the dark satanic mills
That manufacture hell on earth
They bought the front row seats on Calvary
They are irrelevant to meBut I grieve for my sister
People of China
Do not forget do not forget
The children who died for youLong live the Republic
Did we do anything after this
I've a feeling we did
We were watching T.V.Watching T.V.
We were watching T.V.
Watching T.V.
She wore a white bandanna that saidFreedom now
She thought the Great Wall of China
Would come tumbling down
She was a studentHer father was an engineer
Won't you shed a tear
For my yellow rose
My yellow roseIn her bloodstained clothes
Her grandpa fought old Chiang Kai-shek
That no-good low-down dirty rat
Who used to order his troopsTo fire on the women and children
Imagine that imagine that
And in the spring of '48
Mao Tse-tung got quite irateAnd he kicked that old dictator Chiang
Out of the state of China
Chiang Kai-shek came down in Formosa
And they armed the island of QuemoyAnd the shells were flying across the China Sea
And they turned Formosa into a shoe factory
Called Taiwan
And she is different from Cro-Magnon manShe's different from Anne Boleyn
She is different from the Rosenbergs
And from the unknown Jew
She is different from the unknown NicaraguanHalf superstar half victim
She's a victor star conceptually new
And she is different from the Dodo
And from the KankanbonoShe is different from the Aztec
And from the Cherokee
She's everybody's sister
She's symbolic of our failureShe's the one in fifty million
Who can help us to be free
Because she died on T.V.
And I grieve for my sister

By Roger Waters
You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older
And in the end you'll pack, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer.And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest that you've own
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to loose the weight you used to need tothrowaround
So have a good drown, as you go down alone
Dragged down by the stone.I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake of this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out ofthismaze?Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no-one had a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to is late the winner
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.Who was ...

I like staying with my Uncle Dave
And I like playing with his great dane
But I don't fit
I feel alien and strange Kinda out of rangeI like riding in my Uncle's car
Down to the beach where the pretty girls all
parade
And movie stars and paparazzi play
The Charles Atlas kicking sand in the face gameAnd I sit in the canyon with my back to the sea
There's a blood red dragon on a field of green
Calling me backBack to the Black Hills again
Ooh, ooh, Billy come homeBilly is searching for his native land
Flicking through the stations with the dial in his
head
Picking up, andBilly taps out Jim's number on the 'phone
Sits shaking as he waits for Jim's answering tone
Come on my friend, speak to me please
The land of my fathers is calling to me
And I sit in the canyon with my back to the sea
There's a blood red dragon on a field of green
Calling me back, back to the Black Hills again
Ooh, ooh, Billy come homeCome on home
He sits in the canyon with his back to the sea
Sees a blood red dragon on a field of green
He hears a male voice choir singing Billy come
home
Billy, Billy, come home
Come on homeI don't like fish.
You are listening to KAOS here in Los Angeles.
I don't like fish.
Yes, we've established that. Ah! Do you have a request?
Shell fish, guppy, salmon, shrimp and crab and lobster, flounder.I hate fish, but I think most of all I hate fresh fish, like trout. I hate fresh trout. My least-hated, favourite fish would be sole. That way you don't have to see the eyes. Sole has no eyes.
Oh no!
I'd like to be home with my monkey and my dog
Thank you.

When my neurons conspire to direct my thoughts
Away from divorce and competitive sports
Back to the place where all rivers run to the sea
Then I shall be free
Yes I shall be freeOn a see-saw in a strange land
The jackdaw sat on the Cardinal's hand
And the fiddlers played
And the planners plan what would be
On a back seat in a court room
Sat Molly Malone and Leopold Bloom
Until the police came down with a new broom
And swept them cleanLike Geronimo
Like Quinn the Eskimo
Like the Blackfoot
And like the Arapaho
Like Crazy Horse
I'll be the last one to lay down my gunOn the open road in a bar room
A pick up band plays a new tune
When the coloured girls sing
I feel my heart boom
When a new song hits the right note
When a clearing sky saves an old boat
When an insight strikes the mote
From mine own eyeLike Geronimo
Like Quinn the Eskimo
Like the Blackfoot
And like the Arapaho
Like Crazy Horse
I'll be the last one to lay down my gunJust out of sight
Beyond the next range
I'll feel the heat of a flickering flameOn an African Plain by a thorn tree
My old friend Philippe is waiting for me
Que cera, cera
What ever will be will be
When a friend dies and the tears rise
From that deep well that never runs dry
And the women break their bracelets
And the men take their whisky outsideIn a pied-a-terre on the rue St Denis
The red velvet curtain pulls back to reveal
The place where the dark side meets the angel in me
The angel in meWhen my synapses pause in my quest for applause
When my ego lets go of my end of the bone
To focus instead on the love that is precious to me
Then I shall be free
I shall be free

Got a little black book with my poems in,
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in.
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in.
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on,Got those swollen hand blues,
Got thirteen channels of shit on the TV to choose from.
I got electric light, and I got second sight.
Got amazing powers of observation.And that is how I know
When I try to get through on the telephone to you,
There'll be nobody home.
I got the obligatory Hendrix permAnd the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favorite satin shirt.
I got nicotine stains on my fingers,
I got a silver spoon on a chain.Got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains.
I got wild staring eyes,
And I got a strong urge to fly,
But I got nowhere to fly to(fly to, fly to, fly to, fly to, fly to, fly to, fly to).
Oooooh, babe, when I pick up the phone,
There's still nobody home.
I got a pair of Gohill's boots,
And I got fading roots

Who would hurt the children any way they could

I used to think the world was flat
Rarely threw my hat into the crowd
I felt I had used up my quota of yearning
Used to look in on the children at nightIn the glow of their Donald Duck light
And frighten myself with the thought of my little ones burning
But, oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning
The tide is turningSatellite buzzing through the endless night
Exclusive to moonshots and world title fights
Jesus Christ imagine what it must be earning
Who is the strongestWho is the best
Who holds the aces
The East
Or the WestThis is the crap our children are learning
But oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning
The tide is turning
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turningNow the satellite's confused
'Cause on Saturday night
The airwaves were full of compassion and light
And his silicon heart warmedTo the sight of a billion candles burning
Oo, oo, oo, the tide is turning
Oo, oo, oo, the tide is turning
The tide is turning BillyI'm not saying that the battle is won
But on Saturday night all those kids in the sun
Wrested technology's sword from the hand of the war lords
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turningThe tide is turning Sylvester
The tide is turning
"That's it!
Now the past is over but you are not aloneTogether we'll fight Sylvester Stallone
We will not be dragged down in his South China Sea
Of macho bullshit and mediocrity"

Seashell and stone
Surf rushes forward to feel the shingle with fingers of foam
Search for the gold
Over the landscape the mouth of a lifeline unfolds
Smooth and round and brown
See how the sunshine creeps over thistle and down
Hillock and hump, hummock and clump and mound
I feel a lump, see a bump, hear a bulboba sound
Hollow and valley and shadow and dimple and hillGlisten and glimmer and shimmer and sparkle and still
Sunlight is warming the land before your eyes
And the sunrise is on your side
And the sunshine is on your thighs
Lady of stone, you are alone
Lady of stone, you are alone

I just cowered in the corner
My pyjama coat over my head
And she smiled as she finished her sandwich
And her cold eyes fixed me to my dark history
As she brushed the remains
Of our love from the bed
And when she had turned back the covers
When all of the prayers had been read
She said, come on over here you silly boy
Before you catch your death of cold
I was only joking
Let's leave behind the city grime
Let's not compete
It could be fine in the country
Couldn't it though...come on lets go
I said, OK[Young Child:] "Are we going to go now?"
[Jade:] "Where would you like to go darling?"
[Wife:] "Mmm...Vermont...Wyoming."
[Jade:] "Wyoming...huh....Children!"
[Children:] "What?"
[Jade:] "We're going to Wyoming
Darling...Which way is Wyoming?"
[Wife:] "Hook a right here
You're going the wrong way."
[Jade:] "I know that
I know children...
Let's see how many...Volvos we pass
On the way to our new life in the country
...One
[Wife:] "Jade, don't do that, that's really negative."
